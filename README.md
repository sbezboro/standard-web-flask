standard-web-flask
==================

Flask-powered website for the [Standard Survival Minecraft Server](http://standardsurvival.com).

This is a rewrite of the old Django-powered [standard-web](https://github.com/sbezboro/standard-web) repo. The old [DjangoBB](http://djangobb.org/) forum was removed and the forums were rewritten from the ground up to be compatible with the existing schema and data.

Integrates with the [Java plugin](https://github.com/sbezboro/standard-plugin) and communicates to the [Real-time server](https://github.com/sbezboro/standard-rts) to stream console and chat messages.
